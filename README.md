# Spotify EDA & Feature Engineering Project

### Description
Spotify provides a lot of valuable data to analyze. There's a bunch of data concerning tracks, artists, playlists and much more which can be analyzed at various angles. Based on two, already existing datasets I carried out vast analysis with elements of Feature Engineering using Python. You can find detailed descriptions and the whole analytical process in **Spotify_EDA_and_FE.ipynb** file uploaded into this repository.

Since datasets used for this analysis are too large to upload you can find data source links in **.ipynb** file.
